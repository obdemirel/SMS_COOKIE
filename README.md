To run this code, please use main.m

RO:       # of readout lines,
PE:       # of phase encode lines,
NO_C:     # of coil elements,
Slices:   # of slices,
Dynamics: # of cardiac phases,

Input data: (The data shared in the "data" folder only contains 7 T1 dynamics, the original data contains 15. Due to limited data size for Github upload, only is shared here. Please contact with us for the full 15 phase.)
- kspace (RO x PE x NO_C x Dynamics)
- acs (RO x PE x NO_C x Sices) with CAIPI shifts

Input data (shown in image domain, 1st T1 phase of the SMS acquisition):

Output data:
- spsg_res_all (RO x PE x Slices x Dynamics) % Split Slice-GRAPPA output
- sms_cookie_res_all (RO x PE x Slices x Dynamics) % SMS-COOKIE output
- sms_cookie_reg_res_all (RO x PE x Slices x Dynamics) % Regularized SMS-COOKIE output

Output data - Resuls (shown in image domain for split Slice-GRAPPA, SMS-COOKIE and regularized SMS-COOKIE):

SMS-COOKIE
- Input: raw k-space, sensitivity maps, SMS-COOKIE kernels, split Slice-GRAPPA reconstructed k-space, kernel sizes,
         slice acceleration, #of CG iterations
- Output: reconstructed k-space, reconstructed SENSE-1 Images
         
Regularized SMS-COOKIE
- Input: raw k-space, sensitivity maps, SMS-COOKIE kernels, split Slice-GRAPPA reconstructed k-space,  kernel sizes,
         slice acceleration, #of CG iterations, # of ADMM loops
- Output: reconstructed kspace, reconstructed SENSE-1 Images

Regularization:
- Locally low rank (LLR) regularization is supported via ADMM in regularized SMS-COOKIE
- To avoid border artifacts, CAIPIRINHA shifts are re-shifted/shifted before/after the regularization
